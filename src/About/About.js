                    <p>Love More Laugh More is place to motivate and inspire you to care for yourself more so you can...well so you can do all sorts of things, including care for others more. When you are living your best and most joyful life it is easiest to then help others - loved ones and strangers live more joyously too.</p>
                    <p>We think the best way to help you care for yourself more is to help motivate and inspire yourself to show yourself some love every day...or as often as you can.</p>
                    <p>This app provides a place for you to set goals, celebrate your progress, and find ideas for inspiration. We have also included an online gratitude journal - because the more you can appreciate the more you already have, the more you love yourself and the world. </p>
