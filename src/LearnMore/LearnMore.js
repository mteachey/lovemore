                    <p>We would start with either setting your goals for the month. Decide how many times a week (and month) you want to show youself some love and care in the areas of emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and physical well-being. It is completely up to you what you consider giving yourself these different types of self-care.</p>
                    <p>Then, set aside a fee minutes (that's all it should take!) to complete your daily form. In the daily form, is a space to record your self-care activity for the day and what you are grateful for.  There is also a space to record your overall mood and energy-level for the day.</p>
                    <p>Your dashboard will display your most recent self-care activites, a few random gratitude entries, some fun graphs so you can easily see your progress, and a list of your goals.</p>
                    <p>You can also see, sort and filter all of your past self-care activities and past gratitide entries.</p>
